        Battleships is actually quite simple, each player owns a certain number
        of ships, which have different grid sizes. These are then randomly
        distributed on the playing field for the player and his opponent. The
        opponent's ships are invisible to the player, so the player has to start
        guessing where the opponent's ships are. If the player does not hit
        anything (the coordinate turns grey), it is the opponent's turn, who
        does the same as the player. If the opponent does not hit anything
        either (the coordinate turns grey), it is the player's turn. If the
        player hits a ship of the opponent, the part of the ship that was hit at
        this coordinate turns red and the player may guess again. If all parts
        of a ship are hit, its coordinates turn orange and indicate that the
        ship has sunk. Finally, the first player to sink all the opponent's
        ships wins.
